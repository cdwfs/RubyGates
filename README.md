## Acknowledgements

Game design is pretty much a clone of [Circuit Scrambler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg35pi9t8f4). If I can find info on the developer, I will gladly acknowledge them here!

Art design is heavily inspired by the logic gates in [Hello Ruby](https://www.helloruby.com/) by [Linda Liukas](https://www.helloruby.com/about#lindaliukas). Sprite art by Donald Conrad ([@ConManEd)](https://twitter.com/ConManEd))
